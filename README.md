# Generation Simulator

Very simple Python population growth/death simulator. Utilizes Matplotlib to display results.

Use by running __population_simulation.py__ and then you'll be prompted to type in the starting population, generational replacement rate and the length of the generation simulation. Replacement rate is able to be a float, however, the other two inputs must be integer numbers.

Feel free to do whatever with the project! Just wrote it in a day for fun.

# Reason for creating this app

The rate of replacement for a population to continue to exist must always be 2 or higher. That is, for every 2 people, they should have 2 or more kids to keep the human race continueing. This simulation shows what happens when the rate is less then 2 and how quickly a population can go to nothing. At the time of writing this app 1.6 is the rate of replacement. Such a rate of replacement would lead the US to become obsolete in about 40 generations assuming each generation is 25 years and people always live to 100.

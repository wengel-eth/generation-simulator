# Generation Simulator

Very simple Python population growth/death simulator. Utilizes Matplotlib to display results.

Use by running __population_simulation.py__ and then you'll be prompted to type in the starting population, generational replacement rate and the length of the generation simulation. Replacement rate is able to be a float, however, the other two inputs must be integer numbers.

Feel free to do whatever with the project! Just wrote it in a day for fun.
